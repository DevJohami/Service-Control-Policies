# Service-Control-Policies

# 10 important policies to consider:
# 1.Deny Termination of VPCs: This policy prevents accidental deletion of virtual private clouds (VPCs) which can lead to data loss. It ensures that only authorized individuals can terminate VPCs.
# 2.Require Encryption: This policy enforces encryption for data at rest and in transit. It helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.
# 3.Restrict Public Access to S3 Buckets: This policy ensures that Amazon S3 buckets are not publicly accessible by default. It helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data to the public internet.
# 4.Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): This policy requires the use of MFA for accessing AWS accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide an additional authentication factor, such as a code from a mobile app or a hardware token.
# 5.Control Access to AWS Services: This policy limits access to specific AWS services based on user roles and responsibilities. It helps prevent unauthorized use of critical services and reduces the attack surface.
# 6.Enable Logging and Monitoring: This policy ensures that logging and monitoring mechanisms are enabled for various AWS services. It helps detect and respond to security incidents by providing visibility into system activities and events.
# 7.Implement Security Group Restrictions: This policy restricts inbound and outbound traffic by configuring security groups appropriately. It helps enforce the principle of least privilege and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
# 8.Enable VPC Flow Logs: This policy enables VPC flow logs, which capture information about IP traffic flowing in and out of VPCs. It aids in network traffic analysis, troubleshooting, and detecting potential security threats.
# 9.Implement Least Privilege Access: This policy ensures that users and roles are granted only the minimum privileges required to perform their tasks. It helps limit the potential impact of compromised credentials and reduces the risk of accidental or malicious actions.
# 10.Regularly Rotate Access Keys and Passwords: This policy mandates the periodic rotation of access keys and passwords for user accounts. It helps mitigate the impact of leaked or compromised credentials.
